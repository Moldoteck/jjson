No ads, no bs, just a static website

## Features

The only thing you can control is how much spaces to use on format

## Local launch

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Run the server with `yarn start`

## Available Scripts

- `yarn build` — builds the app for production to the `docs` folder
- `yarn lint` — checks if the code is linted and formatted
- `yarn start` — runs the app in the development mode
- `yarn generate-css-types` — generates the CSS types for `tailwind-css`
